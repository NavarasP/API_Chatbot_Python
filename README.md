# Chatbot API

## Description

This project is a conversational chatbot API powered by the OpenAI model. It allows users to have interactive conversations with the chatbot and receive answers to their queries based on a predefined document set.

## Features
- Interactive conversation with the chatbot
- Retrieval-based question answering using the OpenAI model
- Predefined document set for generating responses

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following:

- Python (version  â‰¥ 3.8.1 )

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

3. Change into the project directory:
```
cd your-repository
```
4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2. (Optional) Enable persistence:

- To save the model to disk and reuse it for repeated queries, set the `PERSIST` variable to `True` in the `index.py` file.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
   python index.py

2. Access the chatbot API using the following endpoint:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/chat
``` 

The endpoint expects a JSON payload with the following structure:

```
json
{
  "query": "Your query or message"
}
```

Example usage with cURL:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Hello"}' http://localhost:5000/api/chat
```
The chatbot will respond with a JSON object containing the answer:

```
{
  "answer": "The chatbot's response"
}
```

To end the conversation, you can send one of the following messages:` "quit", "q", or "exit"`.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors or issues while running the project, please ensure that you have followed the installation steps correctly and that all dependencies are installed.
If you encounter any issues with the Langchain library, you may consider using an older version of the library as it could potentially be more stable and have fewer bugs.
If you receive a rate limit error from the OpenAI API, the chatbot will automatically retry up to three times before returning a rate limit exceeded message. You can adjust the MAX_RETRY_COUNT variable in the index.py file if needed.
